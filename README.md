# Tanstack Tables with Tailwind CSS

This project is a up-to-date record for myself to overcome any of table included projects of mine and besides that anyone can benefit.

I've used React as a web framework, tanstack query for reactive fetching, caching, tanstack tables for advanced table management and lastly tailwind css for advanced ui design.
